        <h2>INSPERATION</h2>
        <p>I often fantasized about the future of technology, where AI, vertual assistants, IOT and many more of those thechnologies will be a unseparatable part of our socity. I grewup watching science-friction movies and realized that one of those future technologies is be able to communicate with your seroundings thhrough natural languages. S o This is my first step to a vertual assistant.</p>

        <h2>My approach to build the assistant</h2>
        <p>From fantacy I thought about a website that has a inbuilt Voice Assistant to do every single operation of the website. So I decided to build it in My Portfolio website.</p>
        <p>I started to study google assistant and cortana to get a besic idea about the basic functions to build my own, I started to learn about building voice assistant from YouTube and started to build my own voice assistant</p>
        <p>I started to build it part by part and finally intigrated all the parts together</p>

        <h2>PRE-DEFINED functions</h2>
        <p>As I have seen in the case of <a href="https://assistant.google.com/">Google Assistant</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cortana">Cortana</a> that there are some basic feedbacks that are predefined and the assistant repeats them randomly from provided arry of strings. So I predefined some of the answers for specific questions.</p>

        <h2>Using keywords instead of predefined statements</h2>
        <p>I made it a keywords based approach to increase the freedom to command as in this case "wh" words with some predefined words will lead to a specific reasult with lesser failure chance.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Making of the Navigation through voice</h2>
        <p>The voice assistant would be incomplete with out the power to execute the user commands. One of the most useful features is able to navigate through voice only.</p>
        <p>It was complicated to find out the desired destination of the visitor, after some trial and errors I decided to go with the easiest possibility that I could think of. So, once again I used the keywords to split the string just after the word "To" and That is how the assistant knows visitors desired destination.</p->
        <p>To go to the destination I used the HTML ID attribute to find the location and used click functions</p>

        <!-- <img src="codetest2.JPG" alt="codetest2 img">
        <img src="code3.JPG" alt="code3 img"> -->
        <p>To get the real time weather reaport of any city I had to use "OpenWeathermap" API to get the weather reaport. I used the same strategy of keywords to get the city from the string.</p>
